# PNG and JPEG converter to webp image

I wrote this app to my Next.JS static generated app to convert PNG and JPEG files to webp format

#### Installing

This is a Makefile project just type `make` and the project will be built and installed to `/usr/local/bin` folder.

⚠️ Windows is not currently supported

#### Usage

After install type: `towebp` and the app will locate all the png and jpeg files and converts and writes the webp variant next to the original file with same size.
